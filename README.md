# PSUptimeRobot
A PowerShell module for interacting with the Uptime Robot V2 API.

## About
Uptime Robot is a handy cloud tool for checking website status and offers a decent free tier. You can find it at https://uptimerobot.com.

They also provide a decent REST API for interacting with the service which is documented at https://uptimerobot.com/api

This module is intended to supply a minimum amount of functionality with an eye toward eventually implementing all available endpoints and options. Don't see support for the endpoint or option you need yet? Feel free to submit a PR.
